<COMPLETE> Create a pane that contains a table that displays all the samples in a particular generation 500-999, and includes a column
with calclated generation of the sample
    -create a function that calculates the generation of the sample that takes the list of entries as an input.
        It must be able to iterate through the entries and pick the most recent entry, then compare the experimental generation date
        of the entry to the requested experimental generation date that was inputted into the function
<COMPLETE> Implement JSON serialization and remove java serialization
<COMPLETE> fix a bug where the calculated entry calculation doesn't ignore the first entry if the experimental generation is smaller than the first
    entry (like it should).
<Complete> Account for extinctions
    perhaps by making generation a number less than 0
<Complete> add extinction protocol
    checkbox "extinct"
    find a way to show extinct samples in the list5. Suggested date for each generation
<Complete> Converting to FXML
<COMPLETE>Implement Auto BK calculation when Entry is added. Should recalculate the whole list each time for safety
<COMPLETE>account for 1000-1099 in spinners and in gen calculation (starting at gen 71).
<Complete>Add ability to export all entries in comma delimited format


---Pickers Interface
---clear Notes section after switching sample numbers
---averageBackupGraphingSheet has line info hard coded
---add column with line letter to all relevant tables and lists
---print stats sheet
---make getLineLetter in Entry use settings
--edit mode for entries
    https://gist.github.com/haisi/0a82e17daf586c9bab52
--option to load particular save file, including CSV
--Suggested date for each generation.
    Include this date in the Sample list panel
    Also include this during entry creation
---highlight the newest gen added
---add a text box in the "all entries" area that describes how many total entries are loaded
---hover text that explains what each of the areas are
---add backup number to entry history and sample list
---Add ability to print the Baer MA log that goes into the notebook

--Add unique samples in anticipation of the X lines being thrown out.
    might require an explicit definition of all sample numbers, which are stored in an array that's used to build the sample list
--BAD CODING PRACTICE. Calculated Entry is an object of which hundreds of instances exist, yet each object is instantiated with a complete list of
entries. Is this true?
--BAD CODING. make calculated entries list instead of requiring the calculated entries to build themselves. Complete?


BUGS
---sample 618 gen 65 should be bk1 but is cal as bk2
    due to backed up from 62 (I think?)

NOTES

Calculations
    -'resets' are acknowledged if the entry.backupGeneration = 0 && >=3

BRAINSTORM

Need to find a way to account for X line termination. Need data on when each line went extinct.

Would be cool to calculate stats as well.
